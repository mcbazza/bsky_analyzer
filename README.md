# bsky_analyzer
A port of the excellent tool 'tweets_analyzer', but for Bluesky

Do you remember how great the tool `tweets_analyzer` was for profiling accounts on Twitter, before Eldong broke it all?

Wouldn't a version of that, but for the excellent Bluesky, be really handy? \
Yeah. \
This is that.

Coming soon....

Shouts out to X0rz for `tweets_analyzer`. It was great while it lasted. \
